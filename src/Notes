Notes to "flatten" the 2D-grid and remove 2D arrays

Board: 
Stores all the ships
To print the board:
Loop through all the ships on the board
	> Check if there is a ship at that pixel
		> Check if the point is sunk using the isSunk() method

Instead of adding a ship twice, the code should dynamically create a ship object 
and use a board.addShip(ship) method


Work on using the PointDecoder more in the main method, rather than within the Ship.addShip()
method. 


Dependencies / Exceptions:
Create board should use the row/col generator, but then flatten it to a single number
Check valid should also use a row and column input.
